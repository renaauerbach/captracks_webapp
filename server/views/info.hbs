title="Why Use CapTracks?"
quote='Americans spend roughly 37 billion hours each year waiting in line. The dominant cost of waiting is an emotional one: stress, boredom, that nagging sensation that one’s life is slipping away. The last thing we want to do with our dwindling leisure time is squander it in stasis. We’ll never eliminate lines altogether, but a better understanding of the psychology of waiting can help make those inevitable delays that inject themselves into our daily lives a touch more bearable.'

title="Why Use CapTracks?"
quote='Given the shifts in consumer behavior—more cooking at home, larger baskets, less cross-shopping across retailers—each shopping occasion, for loyal and new customers alike, takes on greater importance for retailers. Find new ways to communicate and deliver value. First, use your unique value proposition as a base for value communications, expanding beyond purely communicating price points. Highlight the areas in which you are best positioned relative to your competitors, whether that’s the broadest private-label offering, the freshest produce, or the best shopping experience.'
